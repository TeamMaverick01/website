Formula Student gives you a distinct edge because you’re not just building a car or completing tasks—you’re constantly asking whether your work creates real impact. That focus on "Impact" forces you to connect efforts with outcomes: performance gains, reliability, cost, timelines, and team goals. Every decision has consequences, and you learn early on to prioritize what truly moves the needle rather than what looks impressive on paper. 

This mindset shift—learning to think in terms of value, results, and measurable impact—is incredibly powerful. This truly sets a tone for the career, be it in any domain!"</p>
